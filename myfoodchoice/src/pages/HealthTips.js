              A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely reduced or blocked. The blockage is
              usually due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances in the heart (coronary) arteries. The
              fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits are called plaques. The process of plaque buildup is called
              atherosclerosis.......
